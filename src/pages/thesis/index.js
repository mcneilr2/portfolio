          <strong>Carbon Nanotube Forests (CNTFs)</strong> exhibit extreme heat localization, creating a confined "hot spot" when exposed to a laser beam of sufficient intensity and frequency. 
          This phenomenon, known as the <strong>Heat Trap Effect</strong>, results in peak temperatures of <strong>over 2000K</strong> at the center of this incandescent spot, which is excited by <strong>tens of milliwats</strong>. This temperature provides the thermal energy to induce thermionic
 emission and multiphoton photo-electron emission, which can be applied to
 devices such as <strong>thermionic energy converters</strong>. This is in contrast to classical
 conductors which require around <strong>3 times</strong> higher irradiance to
 reach the same temperature.

          To determine the <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> of this phenomenon, 
          a <strong>3D IR spectrometer</strong> was constructed which would scan in 2D across the surface of the spot using translational optics,
          measuring the spectral emissions coming from each sub-micron area.  This system deploys a complex system of <strong> optical components, mechatronic stages, thermal sensors and vaccuum chambers</strong> to accomplish this task.
           I modelled this optical system using <strong>Zemax OpticStudio</strong> where I applied
          Gaussian physics principles to predict the behaviour of the beam, the energy applied to the spot and to guide <strong>optical upgrades</strong>.
